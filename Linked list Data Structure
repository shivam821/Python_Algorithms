A linked list is a linear data structure that includes a series of connected nodes. Here, each node stores theÂ data and theÂ address of the next node.

#Linked list Data Structure

class Node():
  def __init__(self,item):
    self.item = item
    self.next = None

class LinkedList():
  def __init__(self):
    self.head = None

if __name__ == '__main__':
  linkedlist = LinkedList()
  linkedlist.head = Node(1)
  second = Node(2)
  third = Node(3)

  linkedlist.head.next = second
  second.next = third

  while linkedlist.head != None:
    print(linkedlist.head.item,end = " , ")
    linkedlist.head = linkedlist.head.next
